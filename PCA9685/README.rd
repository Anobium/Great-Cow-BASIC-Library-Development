# Great Cow BASIC PCA9685 PWM Driver Library

`PCA9685_Library` is a library  for talking to the PCA9685 I<sup>2</sup>C PWM driver by NXP

PCA9685 Highlights from [datasheet](http://www.nxp.com/documents/data_sheet/PCA9685.pdf)
--------

* **16 individually controlled channels**
* **12bit (4096 steps) registers both for on and off time**
* **1MHz fast I<sup>2</sup>C bus interface with 30mA high drive capability on SDA output for driving high capacitive buses**
* **24MHz to 1256MHz PWM frequency for all LEDs with internal 25MHz oscillator**
* **Operating power supply voltage range of 2.3 V to 5.5 V**
* **Six hardware address pins allow up to 62 devices on the same bus**

This is a library for the 16-channel PWM & Servo driver for Great Cow BASIC

Looks something like this
