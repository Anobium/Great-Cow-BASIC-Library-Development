16FUSB - A USB 1.1 implementation for PIC16F628/628A
----------------------------------------------------

The 16FUSB is a software implementation of the USB low-speed for PIC16F628/628A microcontroller. 
All communication stuff is done by the firmware, completely discarding the need to use an 
additional chip. From the 16FUSB core is possible to add implementations of other protocols 
such as, for example, I2C, SPI or simple write data from the USB host (PC) directly to the 
PIC pins. A low-speed USB software implementation can be a great alternative for those who want 
lower cost projects and at the same time also doesn't need high speed data transfer.
