'''  Lesson 10 - "Interrupts and Pull-ups"
'''
'''  This lesson will introduce interrupts and how they are useful. It will
'''  also introduce internal weak pull-ups that are available on most PICs.
'''
'''  It should be noted that this lesson is more efficent than the last
'''  one, "Timer0". Notice how the processor is no longer waiting for
'''  Timer0 to roll over. Instead, we let the hardware modules do the work,
'''  freeing the CPU to do other things in the main loop
'''
'''  The switch is no longer continuously polled for a button press. Instead,
'''  an interrupt will occur which will automically place the program counter
'''  inside of the ISR where we can change directions outisde of normal code execution
'''
'''  LEDs rotate at a constant speed and the switch reverses their direction
