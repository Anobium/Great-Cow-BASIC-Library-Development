'''  Lesson 7 - "Reversible"
'''
'''  This lesson combines all of the previous lessons in using the button to reverse the
'''  direction of rotation when the button is pressed. The speed of rotation is controlled
'''  using the potentiometer.
'''
'''  The program needs to keep track of rotation direction and new code needs to be added
'''  to rotate in the other direction. Lesson 5 rotates right and checks for a '1' in the carry
'''  bit to determine when to restart the sequence. In Lesson 7, the program needs to rotate
'''  both ways and check for a '1' in bit 4 of the display when rotating to the left. When the
'''  '1' shows up in bit 4 of LATC, it will be re-inserted into bit  0 .
'''
'''  The debounce routine is more in-depth in this lesson because we need to keep in mind
'''  of the scenario of the switch being held down for long periods of time. If SW1 is held
'''  down, the LEDs would change direction rapidly, making the display look like it is out of
'''  control. The above flowchart will only change direction on the first indication of a solid
'''  press and then ignore the switch until it is released and pushed again. The switch must
'''  be pressed for at least the time it takes for the program to check the switch in its loop.
'''  Since the PIC MCU is running at 500 kHz, this will seem instantaneous.
'''
'''  LEDs will rotate at a speed that is proportional to the ADC value. The switch will toggle
'''  the direction of the LEDs
