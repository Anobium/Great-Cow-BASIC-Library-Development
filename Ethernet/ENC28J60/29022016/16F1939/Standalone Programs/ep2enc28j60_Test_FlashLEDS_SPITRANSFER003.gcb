''' Description  :
'''      this code sets LEDA as link status display using standard SPITRANSER
'''      and makes LEDB blink permamently
''' target devices :
'''      any PIC with integrated SPI on PORTC
'''      the ENC28J60 SPI plus CLK, SO, SI must be connected to the corresponding SPI pins of the PIC
'''      the INT and WOL signals from the ENC are not used

''' If LEDA is off and LEDB starts blinking, that is good news : the PIC can talk to the ENC controller through SPI communication.
''' If it does not, it should, check again your solderings & connections until it works.
'''
'''  Then connect your board to a hub with a straight cable : LEDA should now turn on with LEDB still blinking. LEDA on means that the adapter is correctly linked to the network. The network link LED of the other side hub should also turn on.
