''' Lesson 11 - "Arrays"
'''
''' This lesson covers a very important topic of Arrays. The code uses indirect
''' addressing to implement a moving average filter. This lesson adds a moving average
''' filter to the Analog-to-Digital code in Lesson 4. The moving average keeps a list of the
''' last ADC values (n) and averages them together. The filter needs two parts: A circular
''' queue and a function to calculate the average.
'''
''' Twisting the potentiometer changes the value read by the Analog-to-Digital converter.
''' The filtered value is then sent to the LED display.
'''
''' This lesson provides the same outcome as Lesson 4. The user rotates the POT to see
''' the LEDs rotate. The top four MSbs of the ADC value are reflected onto the LEDs.
