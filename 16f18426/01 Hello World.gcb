'''
'''  The LEDs are connected to input-outpins (I/O) RC0 through RC3. First, the I/O pin
'''  must be configured for an output. In this case, when one of these pins is driven high
'''  (RC0 =  1 ), the LED will turn on. These two logic levels are derived from the power pins
'''  of the PIC MCU. Since the PIC device?s power pin (VDD) is connected to 5V and the
'''  source (VSS) to ground (0V), a '1' is equivalent to 5V, and a '0' is 0V.
'''
'''
'''  This turns on DS1 LED on the Low Pin Count Demo Board.
