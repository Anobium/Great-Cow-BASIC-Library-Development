''' Lesson 4 - "Analog to Digital"
'''
''' This shows how to read the A2D converter and display the
''' High order parts on the 4 bit LED display.
''' The pot on the Low Pin Count Demo board varies the voltage
''' coming in on in A0.
'''
''' The A2D is referenced to the same Vdd as the device, which
''' is nominally is 5V.  The A2D returns the ratio of the voltage
''' on Pin RA0 to 5V.  The A2D has a resolution of 10 bits, with 1023
''' representing 5V and 0 representing 0V.
'''
'''
''' The top four MSbs of the ADC are mirrored onto the LEDs. Rotate the potentiometer
''' to change the display.
